    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ceviche is made of diced bits of raw seafood, marinated in a lemon or lime juice concoction.</p>
    <p>The acid in the citrus 'cooks' the fish until it becomes opaque and soaks in the flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White Fish</li>
        <li>Marinade</li>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the fish. In a glass (non-reactive) bowl, stir together the fish, lime juice, and lemon juice. Cover the bowl and marinate in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes (and up until 2 hours or so). You’ll notice the fish go opaque as the lime juice “cooks” the fish. The longer you marinate the fish, the more it will cook. See below for more information.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together. Remove the fish from the fridge (no need to drain it) and add the tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, red onion, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, and salt. Gently stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve it up! Serve the ceviche in individual glasses, on a plate, or with tortilla chips.</li>
    </ol>
